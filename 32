1942. The entry of the United States into World War Two, in December 1941, saw U-Boats despatched to US coastal waters, for offensive operations against American ships for the first time. The Americans had virtually no black-out security at this time; harbour lights and ships' navigation lights were both used freely, and radio traffic continued unhindered. Thus the U-Boats had little or no difficulty in finding lucrative target areas. Over 120 ships were sunk during the first three months of the year, and in March the first of the U-Tankers went into action. With fuel resupply now available in the war zone, the effective range of the front-line U-Boat was now almost unlimited. It is estimated that by the end of April over 1,150,000 tons of Allied shipping, representing nearly 200 vessels, had been sunk. In May, however, the Americans began using the convoy system, and tightened up drastically on security. As a result U-Boat successes in American waters tailed off considerably.
