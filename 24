WORLD WAR TWO. 1939. Within two days of the outbreak of war the U-30, under the command of Kapitanleutnant Fritz Julius Lemp, torpedoed and sank the liner Athenia, having mistaken her for an auxiliary cruiser. This led the Allies to think that Germany had the intention of carrying out unrestricted submarine warfare, though this was certainly not the case. The propaganda value for the Allies of this apparently dliberate and dastardly attack on a passenger liner was immense, and caused much embarrassment to the Germans. Hitler ordered that absolutely no action of any kind was to be taken against passenger ships. Better news was received, however, on 17 September, when U-29, under Kapitanleutnant Ono Schuhhart, torpedoed and sank the British aircraft carrier H.M.S. Courageous. Just over a month later, Britain's morale suffered another heavy blow when U-4 7, under Kapitiinleutnant Gunther Prien, penetrated the supposedly impregnable Fleet base at Scapa Flow and sank the battleship Royal Oak, with considerable loss of life. By the end of 1939 U-Boat strength stood at 54 and some considerable successes had been achieved; the sinking of the Royal Oak in particular had delighted Hitler and done much to enhance the status of Konteradmiral Donitz and the U-Boats in the eyes of the Fuhrer1940. This was to be a year of consolidation for the U-Boot Waffe. Although a further 54 U-Boats were commissioned during the course of the year, some 26 were lost to enemy action, so that the net increase was only 28. In 1940 'wolf-pack' tactics were first used successfully against British convoys, and the fall of France presented the Germans with excellent base facilities for their operations in the Atlantic.$
