The pullover shirt was a close-fitting garment made from warm dark blue wooI. It had slit cuffs with button fastenings. The front opening of the shirt, which reached half-way down the chest, was tied with two cornflower blue cords which were then tucked inside the shirt. The shirt itself featured a dark blue flap collar over which the Kieler Kragen was worn.
