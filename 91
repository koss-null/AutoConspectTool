The blouse featured a waistband, with a long tail-piece to one side, which formed the tongue of a belt attachment. This passed through a friction buckle to the other side of the waistband. There seems to have been little or no standardization on the fittings which accompanied this blouse. Examples show field grey or tropical brown painted buttons, with plain black plastic four-hole-type buttons, or with the gilt metal anchor buttons from the blue uniform. Shoulder straps and breast eagles were worn as often as not. Petty and chief petty officers often wore a small chevron of gilt braid (sometimes gilt metal) on the 'point' of the collar. The blouse could be fastened up to the neck, but the top button was almost always left unfastened.
