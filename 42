The installation of snorkel equipment in U-Boats allowed them to recharge their batteries while still under water, thus improving their chance of avoiding detection by Allied ships or aircraft. However, it was a case of too little, too lateA far more important development was the launching of the first Type XXI U-Boat, in April. This new vessel was much larger than the Type VII or Type IX and featured such luxuries s refrigerated food storag and automatic loading devices for the torpedo tubes. Unfortunately the need to retrain crews for service in these technically advanced vessels delayed their introduction into combat service until it was too late.The Allied invasion of Normandy, in June 1941, heralded the end of the U-Boat bases in France. By August all U-Boats in France had been withdrawn to bases in Norway. In September U-Boats were withdrawn from the Mediterranean, and those based in the Black Sea were scuttled. For the first time U-Boat losses exceeded new launchings, with 264 being sunk and only 230 commissioned. Only 131 Allied ships, totalling some 701,900 tons, had been sunk.$
