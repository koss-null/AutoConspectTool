For warrant officers the wreath of oakleaves was removed, leaving the crown and the national cockade. The crown, however, featured ribbon streamers. Although white tops were worn on these caps, the use of the white cover had not begun to see widespread use as the unofficial symbol of the U-Boat commander. The Schirmmutze worn by the Reichsmarine of the Weimar Republic was similar to its Imperial predecessor but with a larger crown, which was usualIy fitted with a wire stiffener, giving it a rigid appearance - the so-called 'Tellerfrmn' or saucer shape. The Imperial crown was deleted from the cap insignia, and the national cockade was replaced by a new one, oval in shape and bearing the black eagle emblem of the Reichsmarine.
