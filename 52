The reefer jacket was cut from fine dark blue woollen worsted or doeskin-type cloth, double-breasted with open collar and lapels in traditional style. It featured two internal skirt pockets with external flaps, and one internal breast pocket, on the left side, without a flap. The jacket had a double row of five gilt metal anchor motif buttons (many of the reefer jackets of the Imperial Navy only featured four pairs), the top pair of which were set slightly wider than the others and were usually for decoration.
