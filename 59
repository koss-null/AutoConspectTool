The pea jacket was sometimes known as the Collani, after a well-known German naval outfitters. It was worn over the traditional sailor's pullover shirt, and featured a double row of fi,c gilt metal anchor buttons (in some late World War Two examples the buttons were simply painted plastic). Early pea jackets had six pairs of buttons; the change to five was made in 1933. As with the reefer jacket, the top pair of buttons was not actually used, and were concealed by the lapels of the jacket.
