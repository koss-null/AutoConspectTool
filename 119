Belts, Buckles and Accoutrements. The standard navy-issue belt for lower ranks was black leather and 4-5 mm wide. On the left end was a metal catch and on the right side, on the inside face, was stitched a leather tongue, 35 mm wide and with seven pairs of holes to which the buckle could be attached. The reverse face of the buckle featured on one side a metal loop into which the belt catch was hooked, and on the other a bar with a double prong fitting for attachment to the tongue.
