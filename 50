U-BOAT UNIFORMS. The German naval uniform has altered little during the course of this century. Apart from dispensing with items such as the frock-coat and the bicorn hat, the basic uniform of today still very much resembles those of the two world wars. To amid unnecessary and space-consuming duplication in the text, rather than deal with each detail of the Kaiserliche Marine, Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine uniforms separately, each uniform garment will be dealt with once, and any important differences between the uniforms of each era will be highlighted. For a fuller study of the uniforms of the Kriegsmarine period the reader is recommended the excellent three-volume work Uniforms and Traditions of the Kriegsmarine by John R. Angolia and Adolf Schlicht (R. James Bender Publishing, California).
