Mention of U-Boats almost invariably brings to mind the great aces of World War Two, names like Kretschmer, Prien, Schepke, Luth, von Tiesenhausen and others, and the equally exceptional achievements of the U-Boat aces of World War One are often forgotten. However, what was probably the greatest single achievement in submarine warfare, the sinking of three major enemy warships by one German U-Boat in a single engagement, occurred during World War One. Korvettenkapitan Lothar Arnauld de la Periere, the greatest U-Boat ace of all time-sinking 54 enemy vessels in a single cruise ï¿½ was also an officer of the Kaiserliche Marine. His name, and others such as Weddigen and Hartwig, though famous throughout the U-Boat fraternity, are little known outside Germany.
