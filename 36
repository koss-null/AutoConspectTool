U-506 and U-507 arrived on the scene and took on a number of the survivors, leaving U-156 engaged in gathering up the numerous scatterd lifeboats in preparation for the arrival of the French warships. On the fourth day after the sinking, an American B-24 Liberator bomber appeared. Hartenstein ordered a large Red Cross flag to be draped over his gun position to show his good intentions, and signalled to the bomber that he had rescued Allied personnel on board. Then an RAF officer who had been rescued took the signalling lamp and repeated the message, adding that there were women and children on board. Despite this, the B-24 attacked, dropping bombs which killed a number of the survivors. The plane then departed, returned to its base, rearmed, and returned to attack the U-156 again, causing further deaths and damage to the U-Boat. Hartenstein was left with no option but to abandon the rescue, and reluctantly ordered the survivors on board U-156 to return to the Laconia's lifeboats, whereupon he left the scene before his boat could be attacked again. It was later discovered that the pilot of the B-2-1 had understood the messages flashed to him from the bridge of the U-156, but had nevertheless been ordered to press home his attack on the grounds that the U-Boat still posed a potential threat to Allied shipping. The survivors from the Laconia had been considered expendableDonitz furiously ordered that never again should one of his U-Boat commanders put his boat and his crew at risk in a rescue operation.$
