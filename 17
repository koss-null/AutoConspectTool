In July 1916 the most effective weapon against submarines so far, the depth charge, claimed its first U-Boat victim. The entry of the United States into the war had also meant a huge influx of warships for the Allies for convoy protection duties and for hunting down the U-Boats. From then on Allied shipping losses were drastically reduced, while U-Boat losses soared. Gradually Allied shipping production over-took losses, and the U-Boat was no longer in a position to decide the war in Germany's favour. Despite a brief flirtation with the concept of U-Cruisers � large submarines fitted with six-inch guns, which did have some success � the German high command lost faith in the U-Boat as the 'wonder weapon' which would bring ultimate victory. By 1918 U-Boat losses in comparison with tonnages sunk had reached an unacceptable level, and the morale of the U-Boat crews had deteriorated drastically. In October of that year, in view of impending peace negotiations, all offensive action against enemy shipping was halted. The last significant part played by the U-Boats in World War One was in the suppression of the German naval mutiny in October 1918. Loyal to the end, U-Boat crews were fully prepared to carry out their orders to 'fire without warning on any vessel flying the red flag.
