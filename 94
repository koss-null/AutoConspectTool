AIthough the ankle-boot was occasionally worn with this form of dress, it seems that the most popular form of footwear on U-Boats was the cam as shoe. It had a sole made from leather or composite material and canvas uppers which were reinforced at the heel, side and toe by leather or composite material. These were both comfortable, practical, and quiet to move about in essential when the U-Boat was rigged for silent running.
