The Tropical Field Cap. A tropical field cap was manufactured for naval personnel. It was cut from khaki-brown denim-type twill material with false flaps and a long peal to shade the eyes from the sun. It had a metal grommet either side of the crown for ventilation. On the front was a machine-wowen eagle and swastika in golden yellow on a tan base, over a machine-woven cockade in the national colours. The lining was usually green, but occasionally red, cotton. Officers' caps were manufactured with gilt aluminium braid piping to the crown.
