Officers and warrant officers were permitted to wear just about any suitable lace-up shoe in plain black leather. A heavier shoe, realy an ankle-boot, was also occasionally worn. As the leg of this boot was covered by the trouser leg, it is almost impossible in most photographs to tell whether shoes or ankle-boots are being worn.
