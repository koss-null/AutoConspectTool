Ranks up to chief petty officer wore the traditional sailor's trousers, cut in dark blue melton cloth and with a flap rather than a fly front. The legs had 60 cm-wide bottoms and were cut to be 2 cm narrower at the knee. German sailor's trousers were pressed with a normal front and back vertical crease rather than the horizontal creases traditional in the Royal Navy. When worn as part of the landing rig, the trouser legs were rolled up slightly, exposing the shafts of the sea-boot.
