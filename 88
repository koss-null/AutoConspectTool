A tropical shirt was also issued. This was a pullover type, with four-button fastening to the slash. It had two pleated patch breast pockets and loops sewn to the shoulder seams to accommodate shoulder straps. An eagle and swastika breast badge, identical to that on the tunic, was positioned over the right breast pocket.
