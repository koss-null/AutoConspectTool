Then, in that same month, the British introduced the 'convoy' system to give merchant ships travelling together some degree of protection. It certainly paid dividends: only two per cent of ships travelling in convoy were lost as opposed to ten per cent of ships travelling alone. At the same time the Allies began a massive series of mine-laying operations, from Scapa Flow to the Norwegian coast, across the English Channel and along the Danish, Dutch and Norwegian coasts, effectively preventing the U-Boats from entering the Atlantic.
