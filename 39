Although the Allies had known of the Enigma encoding device since before the war, it was only in May 1941, after Kapitanleutnant Fritz Julius Lemp's U-110 was attacked and disabled by British escort vessels, that the latest improved version, as supplied to the Kriegsmarine, fell into British hands. Scuttling charges intended to sink the U-Boat had failed to explode, thus allowing a British boarding party to recover the Enigma machine, as well as a copy of the latest codes. The British were now able to intercept all messages between Donitz and his U-Boats. The location of each U-Boat, its destination and its intended target all became known to the Allies; needless to say, U-Boat losses rocketed.
