The Kaiser now gave his unhesitating support to the U-Boat war once again, and in 1917 the efforts of his U-Boat crews were rewarded with remarkable successes: in February 1917 over 256,000 tons of enemy shipping was sunk; in March the total reached 284,000 tons; and in April, over 516,000 tons. Were it not for the United States' entry into the war, in April 1917, it looked almost certain that the U-Boat campaign alone would bring Britain to its knees. In May 1917 over 540,000 tons of shipping was sunk, and the Admiralty gloomily predicted that if things continued thus, the war would be lost by the end of the year.
