In June the Kaiser called off attacks on passenger ships and in September he abandoned unrestricted attacks on merchant ships. The Germans then transferred the bulk of their U-Boat effort to the Mediterranean, and it was in this theatre that the greatest number of sinkings was achieved. In the space of just one month Korvenenkapitan Lothar Arnauld de la Periere sunk 54 ships, a total of over 91,000 tons. He expended just four torpedoes, sinking most of his victims with gunfire while surfaced. A chivalrous adversary, he invariably allowed the crews to abandon ship, and gave them sailing instructions to the nearest landfall before sending their ships to the bottom. By the end of the war he had reached the incredible total of over 200 enemy ships sunk, totaling almost half a million tons.
