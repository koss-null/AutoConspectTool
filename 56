Warrant officers had no sleeve rings; instead, their rank and trade were displayed by means of shoulder straps. These were in dark blue cloth with 2 cm-wide gilt braid edging. In the centre was a small gilt anchor motif with, where appropriate, a trade symbol superimposed on it. Specific rank was shown by small aluminium rank pips. Buttons on all naval jackets bore a fouled anchor motif (an anchor with a rope twisted round its shank) and the edge of the buttons had a twisted rope-effect border. Imperial era buttons also featured the Hohenzollern crown above the anchor. The buttons for the field grey and tropical clothing lacked the rope-effect border and had a field grey or tan painted finish.
