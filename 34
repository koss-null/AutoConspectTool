U-156, under the command of Kapitanleutnant Werner Hartenstein, intercepted and sank the British troopship Laconia on 12 September. On hearing the cries of the survivors in the water, Hartenstein began picking them up. He soon realized that the troopship, as well as carrying British troops, had on board Italian prisoners of war and a number of civilians, including women and children. Soon every square foot of the U-Boat was packed with survivors. Some of the Italian prisoners of war had been bayoneted by their Polish guards as they had tried to escape the stricken ship, and they were treated on U-156, as were other survivors who had suffered shark bites while in the water.
