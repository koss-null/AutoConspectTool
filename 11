The decision to allow unrestricted submarine warfare had, as some Germans had feared, enraged many neutral nations, the United States in particular, since deaths of neutral citizens sometimes occurred. Then, in May 1915, the U-20, under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Walther Schwieger, intercepted and sunk the liner Lusitania off the southern tip of Ireland. Although it was subsequently clearly established that the liner had indeed been carrying contraband war materials, in the form of thousands of cases of ammunition, shrapnel shells and fuses, Schwieger could not have known this, and his sinking of this great liner, with the loss of 1,198 lives, 128 of them American, provoked international outrage.
