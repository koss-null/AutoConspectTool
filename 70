The eagle and swastika emblem on Kriegsmarine shirts was woven in golden yellow artificial silk on a dark blue backing. Rank, trade and specialist insignia were worn on the left sleeve, in the same manner as for the pea jacket and the parade jacket, with the exception that gilt metal badges could not be worn on the shirt.
