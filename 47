ORGANISATION AND COMMAND STRUCTURE. Supreme command of the U-Boats lay with Adolf Hitler in his capacity as Oberbefehlslraber tier Wehrmacht, or commander in chief armed forces. Directly beneath Hitler in the chain of command came the supreme commander in chief navy, or Oberbe.fehlshaber der Mari11e, a post held initially by Grossadmiral Erich Raeder and later by Grossadmiral Karl Donitz. Answering to the Supreme C-in-C navy was the naval high command or Oberkommando der Marine (O.K.M.), which was subdivided into several branches ï¿½ administration, construction, operation and so on.
