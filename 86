Tropical-Issue Uniform. Not specifically intended for U-Boat personnel, but widely worn by them, was the tropical-issue uniform. Its tunic was cut from a brownish-tan denim-type drill material, and was single-breasted with a five-button fastening and pleated patch pockets to the breast and skirt of the tunic. The collar could be fastened at the neck, but was almost invariably worn open. The pockets featured scalloped flaps, and all the buttons on the tunic were of the same style as those for the field grey dress but painted a tan colour. Above the right breast pocket was the eagle and swastika in golden yellow yarn on a tan backing.
