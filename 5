Despite the understandably biased Allied reportage, the vast majority of U-Boat commanders carried out their duties in as honourable a fashion as this type of warfare allowed. This is attested to by the fact that so many Allied senior naval figures came forward after the war, when attempts were being made to vilify U-Boat men as war criminals, and averred that they themselves had behaved in at least as aggressive a manner, if not more so � especially in the case of some American submarine crews serving in Pacific waters � as their German counterparts.
