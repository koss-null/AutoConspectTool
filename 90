U-Boat Battle-dress. A special uniform, closely resembling British battle-dress, was issued to U-Boat crews for wear at sea, and from photographic evidence it seems to have been the most popular of all forms of clothing among U-Boat personnel. The blouse was a short, waist-length garment cut from greyish-green denim-type drill material and fitted with pleated patch breast pockets. The pockets usually have a straight-cut flap. The single-breasted jacket was fastened with five buttons, and the cuffs of the blouse sleeves were slit, with button fastening.
