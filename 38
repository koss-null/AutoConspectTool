1943. The beginning of 19-1-3 saw the Allies launch massive bombing attacks both on the U-Boat bases and on the shipyards where they were constructed. At sea, how-ever, successes against the Atlantic convoys by U-Boat wolf-packs continued. On 16 and 17 March convoys HX-229 and SC-122 came under attack by wolf-packs: 22 Allied ships were sunk, but just one U-Boat lost. Donitz was ecstatic, but his joy would not last, for this was to be the high point of the U-Boat war; the tide turned.
