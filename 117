The Steel Helmet. The steel helmet worn by naval personnel was identical to the army helmet: the Model 1916, ModeI 1918, Model 1935, Model 1940 and Model 1942 'raw edge' types were all worn. The only difference between the army and the navy patterns was in the insignia. On the left side of the helmet was a decal showing a black shield with a gilt eagle and swastika for the navy and a silver shield for the army. Reichsmarine helmets from the Weimer era often featured a shield with two crossed anchors.
