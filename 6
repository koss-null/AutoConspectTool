U-Boat crewmen were predominantly volunteers throughout the war, and selection procedures were rigorous in the extreme, resulting in the U-Boot Waffe taking much of the cream of Germany's naval personnel. Though much depended on the personality of the individual commander, traditionally rigid German military discipline was much relaxed for U-Boat crews. Each man felt himself very much dependent on the others, and an second to none quickly formed among them. To this day, there is a thriving U-Boat veterans 'community', and the U-Boot Waffe has its own very striking war memorial at Moltenort, near Kiel.
