The Work Shirt. Similar in cut to the standard pullover shirt, the work shirt was cut from heavy-duty white moleskin cloth and was fitted with a large patch pocket on the right breast. They had no national insignia or rank insignia, but if required, the Kieler Kragen and black silk neckerchief could be worn. Matching white heavy-duty moleskin work trousers were to be worn with this shirt. The whole uniform had to be very hard-wearing as it invariably became filthy and had to withstand repeated washing.
