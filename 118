The Woollen Cap. A knitted woollen cap was available on official issue finï¿½ naval personnel, and was extremely popular among U-Boat crewmen. It was knitted from dark blue wool in a basic 'tube', with the open end rolled up and the dosed end finished with a woollen pom-pom which gave the cap its nickname, Pudelmutze, or 'poodle cap'.
