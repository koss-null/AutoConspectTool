The Enigma device was, however, only part of the answer: the codes were also needed, and each time the enemy changed the codes, it took time for British intelligence to crack the new codes; in this period, U-boat success would mount once again. By 1943, however, despite the introduction of an improved version of the machine, it was taking British intelligence less than two weeks to crack the new codes. This success, together with new anti-sub-marine measures such as Hedgehog (a multi-barrel-led mortar), acoustic torpedoes dropped by aircraft which homed in on the sound of the li-Boats' engines, detection devices which picked up on the U-Boats' magnetic fields, and, above all, massive strength in escorting ships and aircraft, sounded the death knell for the U-Boats. In May 1943, from over 30 U-Boats sent into action against the Atlantic convoys, almost a third were lost without having fired a single torpedo.
