Deck Personnel . The leather jacket for deck personnel was a three-quarter-length double-breasted reefer-style jacket, usually fastened by four buttons but with a fifth pair which could be used to button the jacket up to the neck in foul weather. It had two internal skirt pockets with external flaps and two slanted slash pockets at lower-chest level. The cuffs were plain. The jacket invariably had a horizontal seam at chest level. Like the jacket for engine personnel, it came in both black and grey leather, with grey predominant among U-Boat personnel. It was occasionally fitted w ith shoulder straps.
