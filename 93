It should also be noted that considerable stocks of British lightweight denim battledress were captured after the fall of France, and were put to good use by U-Boat crews since they closely resembled the German pattern. In wartime black-and-white photographs it can be difficult to detect which is being worn. There are, however, one or two clues: British battledress invariably has scalloped flaps to the pockets, whereas German-made pieces usually (though not always) carried straight-cut flaps; the cuffs to German blouses were slit, with button fastenings, whereas British blouses featured distinct wristbands; and finally, the trousers for British battledress had a large patch pocket just above the knee on the left leg.
