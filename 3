German U-Boat technology, training, tactics and combat successes far exceeded those of any of the other combatant nations, and even as the Third Reich was crumbling, technically advanced vessels such as the Type XXI, many years ahead of its time, were being put into volume productionThe ultimate defeat of the U-Boat threat owed much to a single intelligence coup by the British the discovery of the German 'Schlusselmaschine', the so-called 'Enigma' encoding device, and the subsequent reconstruction of such a device, which led to British cryptologists cracking the German secret codes. Th British were thus able to intercept and decode much of the German signals traffic, allowing them to track down German submarines and their supply vessels at rendezvous points thought to be secret, and to reroute convoys away from areas where U-Boats were know n to be lying in wait.$
