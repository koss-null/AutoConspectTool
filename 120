The face of the buckle bore a disc. A round the lower edge of the disc was a spray of oakleaves, and around the upper edge, the legend 'Gott Mit Uns' (God with us). In the centre, for Imperial naval buckles, was the Hohenzollern crown, for Weimar period buckles the Reichsmarine eagle, and for Kriegsmarine buckles the eagle and swastika. Most early buckles were made of steel, but later examples were made from a number of light metal alloys including aluminium. Those for normal service wear were gilt-finished and those for active service were painted either dark blue or field grey. Belts for use in tropical areas were made from khaki-coloured webbing material.
