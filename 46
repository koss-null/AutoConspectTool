Despite the dwindling successes in the last two years of the war, the U-Boats had achieved a great deal. A total of over 2,800 enemy ships had been sunk over 14 million tons. Despite the horrendous losses suffered, the fighting spirit of the U-Boot Waffe was never crushed. Of around 35,000 men who served in U-Boats, well over 28,000 -over 80 per cent-lost their lives. Although they were deadly adversaries, and were hunted down with great determination, the men of the U-Boot Waffe earned the respect of their enemies, and visitors to the U-Boat memorial at Moltenort today will still find wreaths and tributes from the navies of former adversaries.
