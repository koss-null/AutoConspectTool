One thing worried some factions in the German government: a large proportion of Britain's essential imported materials was carried by neutral ships, and it was feared that attacks on them might bring more countries into the war on Britain's side. By the beginning of 1915, however, the Germans had real ised that their rather optimistic hopes for a speedy victory were unrealistic, and that the war at sea would have to be pursued with greater determination. Accordingly the waters around the coast of Great Britain were declared a war zone by Kaiser Wilhelm, with the warning that any shipping, including neutral ships carrying war materials, encountered there was liable to be sunk without warning. Within eight months the average monthly total of Allied shipping being sunk had risen from just under 50,000 ton to almost 200,000 tons.
