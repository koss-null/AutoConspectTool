In Germany, returning U-Boat crews were welcomed as heroes. All crews were chosen carefully, with only around ten per cent of all volunteers being accepted as of sufficiently high calibre. It was common practice for the crews to visit their boat while it was still under construction ï¿½ effectively getting to know their boat inside out. They then trained intensively for at least two months on their new boat once it had been launched. By the time they set off on the boat's first war cruise, the boat and its crew had become a finely honed fighting machine. Each crew member was confident in his own skills, those of his comrades and, most importantly, those of his commander.
