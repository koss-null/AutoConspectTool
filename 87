Shoulder straps were worn to indicate rank. Those for officers were of the same pattern as on the white summer tunic, while those for NCOs and lower ranks were cut from the same dark tan-coloured material as the jacket itself, and had blue rather than gilt braid edging for NCOs, where appropriate. The sleeves had false turn-back cuffs.
