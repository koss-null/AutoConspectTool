The Allies had little of effect to use against the U-Boats, and by the summer of 1916 around a million tons of Allied hipping had been sunk. Although the British did make use of the so-called 'Q-ships' - auxiliary cruisers disguised a innocent merchantmen intended to lure the U-Boat to the surface, whereupon the cruiser would bring her hidden guns to bear and sink the U-Boat during the entire war only 14 U-Boats were lost in this war. In one such case, when U-27 was sunk by the Q-Ship Baralong, the survivors from U-27, including her captain, expecting to be rescued by the British, were hunted down one by one and brutally shot. By mid-1916 the U-Boat fleet had grown dramatically, and numbered over 134 vessels, including massive U-Freighters ï¿½ large submarines that could bring vital supplies of war materials through the British blockade of German waters. By the end of that year Allied shipping losses were reaching crisis proportions. Between October and December of 1916 alone almost half a million tons of shipping were lost.
