The field grey naval blouse was very similar to that of the German army, and indeed some stocks of army clothing were used by naval personnel. The naval version usually featured a plain field grey collar. There were four pockets ï¿½ two pleated patch pockets on the breast and two flapped slash pockets on the shirt. The blouse was ingle-breasted and fastened by five buttons bearing the anchor motif and painted field greyThe eagle and swastika emblem was worn over the right breast pocket, and was either machine-wowen or machine-embroidered in golden yellow thread on a field grey or dark green base. Collar patches were in army style: two bars of mouse grey litzen with a yellow stripe to the centre of each and the space in between the bars in white.$
