Collar patches were worn with the pea jacket. For lower ranks they were in plain blue (which varied from a royal blue to a dark blue only a few shades lighter than the pea jacket itself). Petty officers had a single strip of gilt braid and chief petty officers two strips of gilt braid. For both petty officer grades the collar was to have featured 2 cm-wide gilt braid edging, though this was sometimes missing.
