The White Summer Tunic. Photographs show U-Boat officers wearing this tunic when on service in the tropics, though it would not normally be worn on board ship. SeveraI U-Boats operated in Pacific waters, from Japanese-controlled bases, and the white uniform was often worn on shore as standard service dress.
