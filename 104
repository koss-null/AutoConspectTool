The Peaked Cap. The peaked cap, or Schirmmutze, was the headgear most commonly worn by officers and warrant officers of the U-Boot Waffe of both the Kaiscrliche Marine and the Kriegsmarine. The version worn in the Kaiser's navy consisted of a fine dark blue wool or doeskin top, of fairly small dimensions, fitted to a band covered with a woven black mohair capband and featuring a shiny black leather peak fitted with black leather edge binding. It had a black leather chinstrap held by two small gilt metal anchor motif buttons.
