For officers the normal service dress belt was made from brow n or black leather 50-55 mm wide with an open rectangular buckle with double claw fitting and pebbled finish, in a matt silver colour. For parade or full-dress formal occasions, it was made from woven aluminium brocade and was 50 mm wide and backed with dark blue cloth. Two broken black lines were woven into the brocade laterally with the belt, around 15 mm from each edge. The buckle used was circular and comprised a wreath of oakleaves surrounding a ribbed field on which sat a fouled anchor (topped by a Hohenzollern crown on Imperial examples). A 22 mm-wide slide in the same style as the belt was sited either side of the buckle. The buckle was finished in gilt for line officers and silver for administrative officials. A smaller version of this buckle was also worn on a 35 mm-wide ribbed black fabric belt worn under the jacket or coat and from which was hung the dagger or sword: the hanging straps passed through a slit in the lining and appeared from under the pocket flap.
