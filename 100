Foul-Weather Wear. Basic foul-weather wear consisted of a large, loose-fitting, knee-length double-breasted jacket in black rubberised material. It had two slanted slash pockets at lower-chest level. The interior lining of the sleeve was elasticated at the wrist, and the large collar could be turned up and fastened across the throat by a small strap to protect the side and rear of the wearer's head.
