Kriegsmarine parade jackets featured the eagle and swastika national emblem on the right breast, just above the level of the top button. Rank and trade insignia were worn on the left sleeve, in exactly the same fashion as for the pea jacket. The parade jacket was worn over the traditional sailor's pullover shirt, but unlike the pea jacket, the sailor's collar, or Kieler Kragen, was worn outside the jacket.
