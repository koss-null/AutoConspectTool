Around 1936 the cap was redesigned. It received a larger crown, usually worn without the wire stiffener, giving it a floppy appearance. For officers the peak was covered in dark blue cloth and bound in black leather. On the blue cloth covering the rank grouping was embroidered. For Leutnant to Kapitanleutnant it was a narrow band of gilt scallops, with the curves towards the cap; for Korvettenkapitan to Kapitan it was a wide band of gilt oakleaves; and for ranks from Kommodore up-wards, a double-wide band of gilt oakleaves. Cap insignia were almost invariably embroidered, in gilt wire or yellow celluloid thread, though the gilt metal eagle and swastika continued to be worn on the white summer top. For warrant officers the peak was in shiny black leather, or Vulkanfibre, with leather edge binding.
