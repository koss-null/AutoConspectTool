Rank and trade were indicated by a series of arm badges. For lower ranks this comprised the trade symbol with rank chevrons, where appropriate. For petty officers it comprised a large fouled anchor with the trade symbol superimposed on it, where necessary, and for chief petty officers, a single chevron below this insignia. The badges were golden yellow cotton embroidery on dark blue cloth. Petty and chief petty officers, however, could privately purchase fine gilt metal examples of their badges.
