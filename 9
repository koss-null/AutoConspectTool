THE KAISERLICHE MARINE. When war began on 1 August 1914, Germany possessed only 20 U-Boats ready for action, compared with the Royal Navy's total of over 70 submarines. Three days later, Great Britain declared war on Germany, and ten U-Boats, half of Germany's entire fleet, set off on their first war cruise. Their target was nothing less than the Grand Fleet. In the event, two U-Boats were lost one to a minefield ï¿½ and not a single British warship was sunk; the cruise was a complete failure. On 5 September, however, the U-Boats scored their first major success when Leutnant zur See Otto Hersig sank the cruiser H.M.S. Pathfinder. Barely three weeks later Oberleutnant zur See Otto Weddigen encountered a force of British warships. In the space of less than an hour he sent the cruisers Aboukir, Cressy and Hogue to the bottom. Germany was delighted with its new heroes, and every member of the crew was decorated. Weddigen's boat, the U-9, was granted the right to bear the emblem of the Iron Cross on its conning-tower. No one could now doubt the potency of the U-Boat as a weapon, and German attacks on Allied shipping steadily increased.
