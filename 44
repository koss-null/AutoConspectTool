Although some dozen or so Type XXI U-Boats were ready for action by the end of the war, only one saw combat action: U-2511, commanded by Korvettcnkapitan Adalbert Schnee. It intercepted a powerful British surface force, including a heavy cruiser with its attendant escorting screen of destroyers. Schnee's U-Boat passed through the escorts undetected, and set up a dummy attack on the cruiser, which went off perfectly. Unfortunately for Schnee, the order to cease hostilities had already been given, and he was obliged to allow his target to pass unmolested.
