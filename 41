Donitz reluctantly ordered his U-Boats withdrawn from operation in North Atlantic. During 1943 some 290 new U-Boats were launched, but losses were vry heavy, at 245. Although some 451 enemy ships had been sunk, totalling 2,395,500 tons, this was less than half the number of the previous year1944. U-Boat activity was drastically curtailed by 1944, though in the Mediterranean, U-Boats saw action against the Allied invasion fleet at Anzio.$
