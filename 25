Successes varied. In April only six Allied ships, totalling some 30,900 tons, were sunk, while in June 63 Allied ships were sent to the bottom, some 355,400 tons. In all, 1940 saw the loss of just under 500 Allied ships to U-Boat attacks, around 2,373,000 tons. This was also the year in which some of the great aces began to make themselves known by their achievements; Prien and Schuhhart had achieved instant fame through the sinking of major enemy warships. Otto Kretschmer, Wolfgang Luth, Victor Oehrn and Joachim Schepke, to name but a few, joined the ranks of the Ritterkreuztrager, receiving the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for running up considerable scores of enemy merchant shipping sunk. July of 1940 also saw restrictions on U-Boat operations lifted: all waters around Great Britain became a war zone in which any merchant shipping was liable to be attacked. The bases in France and occupied Norway also gave the Germans the opportunity to greatly expand U-Boat operations, and Allied shipping was soon being sunk as far afield as the waters off the coast of Africa and off North and South America.
