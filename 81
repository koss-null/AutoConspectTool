The Work Jacket. The work jacket, intended for use by junior NCO grades, was widely used by U-Boat personnel. It was a single-breasted jacket with plain patch pockets on the skirt. The pockets had no flaps. It was cut from greyish-green hard-wearing drill fabric and fastened by four plain plastic four-hole-type buttons, with the top button usually left unfastened. It often, though not invariably, featured the eagle and Swastika emblem on the right breast. Near to the bottom of each sleeve was a small button-fastened strap for adjustment.
