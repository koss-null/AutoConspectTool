At sea the men lived in barely tolerable conditions. The Type VII was approximately 220 feet long and only 20 feet across at its widest point. Into this very limited space, as well as all the essential machinery and equipment, torpedoes, rations and so on, were crammed around 45 men. Each shared his bunk with a comrade, on a rotate system: as one left to go on watch, his bedspace would be taken by a comrade who had just finished his shift. No smoking was allowed on board, and shaving was a rare luxury, as was a proper wash. Special soap was provided for use with sea water, but it was all but useless. Conditions were almost invariably damp, so wet clothes rarely dried properly. Food quickly began to rot, and the atmosphere became foul. On top of all this there were only two toilets, one of which was usually used for storing rations, leaving only one in action ï¿½ shared by over 40 men!
