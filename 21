The powerful and influential Krupp family had begun to finance a firm in The Hague, Holland, employing German engineers to design and build submarines, ostensibly for sale to foreign powers such as Japan, Turkey and Holland itself In fact the firm, known as Ingenieunkantoor voor Scheepsbouw, was also busily involved in manufacturing essential components for U-Boat construction, and was shipping them back to Germany for stockpiling. Following the Nazi accession to power, Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, in March 1935, and by the end of that year the carefully stockpiled components manufactured in Holland had been put to good use in the assembly of 14 U-Boats at the naval yards in Kiel. By mid-1939 the number of U-Boats available had risen to almost 60.
